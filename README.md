# AutomatedStorytelling
Using OpenAI GPT-2, the model will finish your blog posts; or whatever else you wish to talk about. Model is very fast on Google Cloud (Tesla GPUs).

This is a Flask Wrapper around the OpenAI (small) model which can be found here: https://github.com/openai/gpt-2


TODO:

Update model here to the "medium" sized model
Implement "Gurus"
Cleanup bad words from generated text
